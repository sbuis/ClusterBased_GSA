# Code for Cluster-Based GSA method

This repository provides the code of the Cluster-Based GSA method applied on the ToyCurves model as presented in (Roux, Buis et al., submitted to ENVIRON. MODELL. SOFTW.).

[`clusterBasedGSA_on_Toycurve.md`](https://github.com/sbuis/ClusterBased_GSA/blob/master/clusterBasedGSA_on_Toycurve.md) includes both the R code and its results. We advise to look at it if you want to know how the method is implemented. 

If you want to test or adapt the method, please clone or download the repository and consider the R project clusterBasedGSA_on_Toycurve.Rproj. It includes an Rmarkdown file (clusterBasedGSA_on_Toycurve.Rmd) that contains and comments the code. It can be easily run and adapted to your own model, e.g. using Rstudio.
